# Part 1

## Question 1

Create an array of strings called `colors` that contain "orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", and "lavender".

Then, using array subscripting and string interpolation, print out the String `"orange, yellow, and lavender are some of my favorite colors"`.

```swift
//Answer:

let colors = [ "orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", "lavender"]

let favColor = "\(colors[0]), \(colors[2]) and \(colors[colors.count - 1]) are some of my favorite colors"
print(favColor)
```

## Question 2

Remove "Illinois" and "Kansas" from the array below.

`var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]`

```swift
//Answer:


westernStates.remove(at: 5)
westernStates.remove(at: 4)
print(westernStates)
```

## Question 3

Iterate through the array below. For each state, print out the name of the state, a colon, and whether it is or is not **in the continental United States.**

`let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]`

```swift

//Answer:

for state in moreStates {
    if state != "Hawaii" {
        print("\(state): is in the continental United States")
    } else {
        print("\(state): is not in the continental United States")
    }
}
```

## Question 4

Print out how many non-whitespace characters are in `myString`:

`let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"`

Iterate through the array below. For each sentence, print out how many non-whitespace characters are in it.

`let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]`

```swift

//Answer:

var counter = 0
for char in myString {
    if char != " "{
        counter += 1
    }
}

print("There are \(counter) non space charctaers in myString")

var count = 0

for quote in myFavoriteQuotes {
    for char in quote {
        if char != " "{
            count += 1
        }
    }
    print("There is \(count) in the quote: \(quote) ")
count = 0
}
```

## Question 5

Iterate through `garden` and place any 🌷 that you find into the `basket`. Replace any 🌷 that you pick up with `"dirt"`. Then print how many 🌷 are in your `basket`.

```swift
//Answer:

var garden = ["dirt","🌷","dirt","🌷","dirt","dirt","🌷","dirt","🌷","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()

for (index, item) in garden.enumerated() {
    if item == "🌷" {
        basket.append(item)
        garden[index] = "dirt"
    }
}

print("There are \(basket.count) 🌷 in my garden")
// print(garden)
```

## Question 6

The below array represents an unfinished batting lineup for a baseball team. **You, the coach,** need to make some last minute changes:

- Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
- Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
- Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
- Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.

`var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]`

```swift
//Answer:

//Add
battingLineup.append("Suzuki")

//Replace
let firstIndexOfJeter = (Int(battingLineup.firstIndex(of: "Jeter") ?? 1))
let firstIndexOfThmoas = (Int(battingLineup.firstIndex(of: "Thomas") ?? 1))
battingLineup[firstIndexOfJeter] = "Tejada"
battingLineup[firstIndexOfThmoas] = "Guerrero"

//Move
battingLineup.remove(at: 0)
battingLineup.insert("Reyes", at: 7)
print(battingLineup)
```

## Question 7

Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.  

(The built-in `contains(_:)` function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)


```swift
var numbers: [Int]

let target: Int = 32

// Answer:

var contains = false

for num in numbers {
    if num == target {
        contains = true
    }
}

print(contains)
```

Ex.1

```swift
numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]

target = 32

//true
```

Ex. 2

```swift
numbers = [32459,2,4,5,1,4,2,1]

target = 3

//false
```


## Question 8

Find the largest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built-in `max()` method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.

//Answer

var largestNum = 0
for num in arrayOfNumbers {
    if num > largestNum {
        largestNum = num
    }
}

print(largestNum)
```



## Question 9

Find the smallest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built in min() method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.

//Answer:

var smallestNum = arrayOfNumbers[0]

for num in arrayOfNumbers {
    if num < smallestNum {
        smallestNum = num
    }
}

print(smallestNum)

```


## Question 10

Iterate through `secondListOfNumbers`, and print out all the odd numbers.

`var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]`
```swift
//Answer:

for num in secondListOfNumbers {
    if num % 2 == 1 {
        print(num)
    }
}

```

## Question 11

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`
```swift
// Answer:

var sum = 0

for num in thirdListOfNumbers {
    sum += num
}

print(sum)
```

## Question 12

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum of all the even numbers.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`

```swift
Answer:

var newSum = 0

for num in thirdListOfNumbers {
    if num % 2 == 0 {
        newSum += num
    }
}

print(newSum)
```

## Question 13

Append every Int that appears in both `listOne` and `listTwo` to the `sharedElements` array. Then print **how many Ints** are shared.

```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()

// Answer:

for num1 in listOne {
    for num2 in listTwo{
        if num1 == num2 {
            sharedElements.append(num1)
        }
    }
}

print(sharedElements)
```

# Part 2

## Question 1

Write code such that `noDupeList` has all the same Ints as `dupeFriendlyList`, but has no more than one of each Int.

```swift
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []
```

## Question 2

Find the second smallest number in an Array of Ints

`let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}`


## Question 3

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


## Question 4

Make an array that contains all elements that appear **more than twice** in `someRepeatsAgain`.

```swift
var someRepeatsAgain = [25,11,30,31,50,28,4,37,13,20,24,38,28,14,44,33,7,43,39,35,36,42,1,40,7,14,23,46,21,39,11,42,12,38,41,48,20,23,29,24,50,41,38,23,11,30,50,13,13,16,10,8,3,43,10,20,28,39,24,36,21,13,40,25,37,39,31,4,46,20,38,2,7,11,11,41,45,9,49,31,38,23,41,16,49,29,14,6,6,11,5,39,13,17,43,1,1,15,25]
```


## Question 5

Identify if there are 3 integers that sum to 10 in the following array. If so, print them as a triplet. If there are multiple triplets, print all possible triplets.

`var tripleSumArr = [-20,-14, -8,-5,-3,-2,1,2,3,4,9,15,20,30]`


## Question 6

Given an array of Strings, find the the String with the most "a"s in it.

input: `["apes", "abba", "apple"]`

output: `"abba"`

```swift
var mostACount = 0
var stringWithMostAs = ""

for str in arr {
    var LocalACount = 0 
    
    for char in str{ 
        if char == "a" { //"apes"
            LocalACount += 1
        }
    }
    
    // here we will compare a's count
    if LocalACount > mostACount {
        mostACount = LocalACount
        stringWithMostAs = str
    }
}

print(stringWithMostAs) // Prints "abba"

```

Output: `[(-3,-3), (1,1)]`


## Question 9

Given an Array of Bools, make a variable called `allAreTrue` that is true if all of the Bools are true and false if any of them are false.

Input: `[true, false, true, true]`

Output: `false`


## Question 10
